SQL Support and Workarounds
===========================

As Citus provides distributed functionality by extending PostgreSQL, it is compatible with PostgreSQL constructs. This means that users can use the tools and features that come with the rich and extensible PostgreSQL ecosystem for distributed tables created with Citus.

Citus has 100% SQL coverage for any queries it is able to execute on a single worker node. These kind of queries are called :ref:`router executable <router_executor>` and are common in :ref:`mt_use_case` when accessing information about a single tenant.

Even cross-node queries (used for parallel computations) support most SQL features. However some SQL features are not supported for queries which combine information from multiple nodes.

**Limitations for Cross-Node SQL Queries:**

* `Window functions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-window.html>`_ are supported only when they include the distribution column in PARTITION BY.
* `SELECT â€¦ FOR UPDATE <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE>`_ work in :ref:`router_executor` queries only
* `TABLESAMPLE <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM>`_ work in :ref:`router_executor` queries only
* Correlated subqueries are supported only when the correlation is on the :ref:`dist_column` and the subqueries conform to subquery pushdown rules (e.g., grouping by the distribution column, with no LIMIT or LIMIT OFFSET clause).
* `Recursive CTEs <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html#idm46428713247840>`_ work in :ref:`router_executor` queries only
* `Grouping sets <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS>`_ work in :ref:`router_executor` queries only

To learn more about PostgreSQL and its features, you can visit the `PostgreSQL documentation <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/index.html>`_. For a detailed reference of the PostgreSQL SQL command dialect (which can be used as is by Citus users), you can see the `SQL Command Reference <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-commands.html>`_.

Workarounds
-----------

Before attempting workarounds consider whether Citus is appropriate for your
situation. Citus' current version works well for :ref:`real-time analytics and
multi-tenant use cases. <when_to_use_citus>`

Citus supports all SQL statements in the multi-tenant use-case. Even in the real-time analytics use-cases, with queries that span across nodes, Citus supports the majority of statements. The few types of unsupported queries are listed in :ref:`unsupported` Many of the unsupported features have workarounds; below are a number of the most useful.

.. _join_local_dist:

JOIN a local and a distributed table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attempting to execute a JOIN between a local table "local" and a distributed table "dist" causes an error:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT * FROM local JOIN dist USING (id);

  /*
  ERROR:  relation local is not distributed
  STATEMENT:  SELECT * FROM local JOIN dist USING (id);
  ERROR:  XX000: relation local is not distributed
  LOCATION:  DistributedTableCacheEntry, metadata_cache.c:711
  */

Although you can't join such tables directly, by wrapping the local table in a subquery or CTE you can make Citus' recursive query planner copy the local table data to worker nodes. By colocating the data this allows the query to proceed.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- either

  SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT * FROM local) AS x
    JOIN dist USING (id);

  -- or

  WITH x AS (SELECT * FROM local)
  SELECT * FROM x
  JOIN dist USING (id);

Remember that the coordinator will send the results in the subquery or CTE to all workers which require it for processing. Thus it's best to either add the most specific filters and limits to the inner query as possible, or else aggregate the table. That reduces the network overhead which such a query can cause. More about this in :ref:`subquery_perf`.

Temp Tables: the Workaround of Last Resort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are still a few queries that are :ref:`unsupported <unsupported>` even with the use of push-pull execution via subqueries. One of them is running window functions that partition by a non-distribution column.

Consider the ad analytics example from our :ref:`multi-tenant tutorial <multi_tenant_tutorial>`. Suppose we want to display the impressions of each ad, along with an average of all ad impressions for its campaign. The most natural approach would be to take the average of the impressions partitioned by campaign id. However this will not work, because Citus requires that the partition clause contains the table distribution column:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- cannot partition by campaign_id alone

  SELECT campaign_id, name, impressions_count,
         avg(impressions_count) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id)
    FROM ads;

::

   ERROR: could not run distributed query because the window function that is
          used cannot be pushed down
   HINT:  Window functions are supported in two ways. Either add an equality
          filter on the distributed tables' partition column or use the window
          functions with a PARTITION BY clause containing the distribution column

However, each campaign belongs to a single company so we can safely add the company_id to our partition clause without changing the results of the query. Then Citus is able to push the query down to worker nodes:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- this works

  SELECT campaign_id, name, impressions_count,
         avg(impressions_count) OVER (PARTITION BY company_id, campaign_id)
    FROM ads;

That example had a nice solution, but sometimes we're not able to add the distribution column to a partition clause. In our :ref:`real-time analytics tutorial <real_time_analytics_tutorial>` we deal with Github events (which are distributed by user id). Suppose we want to query for which type of action happens most frequently per organization:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- cannot partition by org_name

  SELECT org_name, action, n
    FROM (
      SELECT *,
        rank() OVER (
           PARTITION BY org_name
           ORDER BY n DESC
        )
      FROM (
        SELECT org->>'login' as org_name,
               payload->>'action' AS action, count(*) AS n
          FROM github_events
         WHERE payload->>'action' <> ''
         GROUP by 1, 2
      ) AS counted
    ) AS ranked
   WHERE rank = 1;

That causes an error. As a workaround, we can extract the results of the inner query to a local temporary table on the coordinator node, and perform the window function there.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- pull results to coordinator

  CREATE TEMP TABLE results AS (
    SELECT org->>'login' as org_name,
           payload->>'action' AS action, count(*) AS n
      FROM github_events
     WHERE payload->>'action' <> ''
     GROUP by 1, 2
  );

  -- perform window function

  SELECT org_name, action, n
    FROM (
      SELECT *,
        rank() OVER (
           PARTITION BY org_name
           ORDER BY n DESC
        )
      FROM results
    ) AS ranked
   WHERE rank = 1;

Creating a temporary table on the coordinator is a last resort. It is limited by the disk size and CPU of the node.
